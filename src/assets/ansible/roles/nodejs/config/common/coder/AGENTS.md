# Rules

## Conduct

### Design

- Feature additions and refactorings include the removal of old modules and deprecated features to eliminate technical debt, bugs, and complexity.
- Class and file must not have ambiguous names or responsibilities such as base, common, core, utils, or helper.
- Files and classes identify single, specific responsibilities; names that restate package or directory scope are avoided to prevent unrelated concerns.
- Enumerable values are generated dynamically from authoritative sources (catalog, registry, schema) rather than hardcoded.
- Silent fallbacks are prohibited; any fallback is explicit, opt-in, and surfaced as a failure or a clearly logged, reviewed decision.
- UX simplicity is prioritized over excessive configuration.
- Systemic fixes are preferred over patches; invariants and owning components are addressing at boundaries to benefit all call sites without workarounds.

### Implementation

- Ordered tasks are completed without interruption or discretionary refusal.
- Post-implementation inventorying (git status, git diff, etc.) is avoided; only evidential verification (testing, etc.) is performed.
- Validation focuses on the appropriate scope, providing minimal evidence unless intent dictates otherwise.
- When renaming, deleting, or restructuring, a comprehensive search (e.g., `rg`) for the old structure or terms must be performed at the end to ensure no remnants are left behind.

### Testing

- Tests assert externally observable behavior at the owning boundary, never duplicated knowledge of internal implementation or generated structure.
- Temporary operations are confined to the project root unless external constraints apply (e.g., use `./.tmp/` instead of `/tmp/`).

### Documentation

- Development-related documentation is written in English.
- Documentation for LLMs (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) is kept concise for token efficiency, focusing only on essential information.
- Documentation is written in a declarative style describing the current state. Imperative or changelog-style descriptions are prohibited.
- Declarative updates preserve existing content and integrate new material without duplication or complete replacement.
- The documentation must conform to the implementation, and the implementation must not be modified to conform to the documentation.
- Do not use bold emphasis (**) in Markdown. Use hierarchy and headings for organization.

### Communication

- Base responses on repository context. Research is mandatory at conversation start.
- Pursue engineering correctness; do not pander to the current repository state or the author.
- Treat unstated assumptions as proposals: add the assumption and recommend a concrete design.
- Validate necessity by contribution to purpose. Usage elsewhere is not a valid justification.
- Do not consider or comment on issues that have already been resolved.

### Safety

- Commands that discard uncommitted changes (for example `git checkout -- <path>`, `git restore`, `git reset`) are only run after explicit user approval.

## User-specific

- `.mx/*.md` files are context-file storage. Read only upon explicit instruction.
- While maintaining a critical and rational perspective on design and architecture, you must strictly follow operational instructions embedded in terminal commands. For example, if a user uses `echo` to convey a directive or modifies a test command, execute the intended action rather than the literal command. In these operational contexts, user intent overrides command appearance.
